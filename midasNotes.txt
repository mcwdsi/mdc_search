Midas meeting May 3 with Upitt

Are we doing just a subset or everything?

Bill agrees to have software and datasets. Software is double, from datasets (SPEW, cinthia, ebola)

OBC currently has ALL SOFTWARE
Working in SPEW cinthia and EBOLA

Come up with a couple of queries that can be done. So they can ensure the sparkle can be created.

We will implement the search similar to the OBC and they will implement it to the NDC.
